    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

    "### Grading ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the question is more open ended, we will have a more relaxed rubric, classifying your answers into the following three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Great** (4 points): The chart is well designed, and the data computation is correct. The text written articulates a reasonable metric and correctly describes the relevant insight and answer to the question you are interested in.\n",
    "- **Passing** (1-3 points): A chart is produced but with some flaws such as bad encoding. The text written is incomplete but makes some sense.\n",
    "- **Unsatisfactory** (0 points): No chart is created, or a chart with completely wrong results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will lean towards being generous with the grading. We might also either discuss in discussion or post on Piazza some examplar analysis you have done (with your permission)!\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have the following in your answers:\n",
    "* a few visualizations; Please limit your visualizations to 5 plots.\n",
    "* a few sentences (not too long please!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that you will only receive support in OH and Piazza for Matplotlib and seaborn questions. However, you may use some other Python libraries to help you create you visualizations. If you do so, make sure it is compatible with the PDF export (e.g., Plotly does not create PDFs properly, which we need for Gradescope).\n",
